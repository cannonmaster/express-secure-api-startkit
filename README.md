# Express Secure API Tempatle

This is an API template based on Express.js, designed to provide a secure and reliable starting point for building your Node.js applications.

## Features

- Configurable maximum payload size for incoming requests.
- Enhanced security using the Helmet middleware, including CSP.
- Protection against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP).
- Rate Limit and Slow Down middleware to prevent malicious requests and Denial of Service attacks.
- CSRF protection to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.
- Integrated Winston logger for logging important events in the application.
- Provides an example of captcha generation and validation.
- CORS support integrated, allowing cross-origin requests.
- Configurable via environment variables.

## Areas for Further Optimization Based on Project Specifics

- Sanitize all user inputs.
- Validate data again before processing, e.g., validate data types.
- Only return necessary data.
- Prevent users from extending objects, which can be achieved using `preventExtension`.
- Use ACL for control if necessary.
- Avoid using unsafe functions like `eval`.
- Scan the project with scanning tools to avoid Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks.

## Usage Instructions

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Rename the configuration file
   .example.env -> .env

3. Start the application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The application will run on the default port 3000. You can configure the port and other environment variables in the `.env` file.

4. Access the CSRF token:

   Make a GET request to retrieve the CSRF token:

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000/csrf-token
   ```

5. Access protected endpoints:

   Make a POST request to access a protected endpoint:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-CSRF-Token: your-csrf-token-here" -d '{"data": "example"}' http://localhost:3000/protected_endpoint
   ```

   Replace `your-csrf-token-here` with the CSRF token obtained from step 3.

6. Access the captcha:

   Make a GET request to retrieve the captcha:

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000/captcha
   ```

   You will receive an SVG-format captcha image.

## Environment Variables

You can configure the application's environment variables using the `.env` file. Here are some example environment variables you can use:

- `PORT`: Specifies the port number for the application.
- `WINDOW_MS`: Window time for Rate Limit and Slow Down middleware.
- `MAX_REQUESTS_PER_IP`: Maximum number of requests allowed per IP address.
- `DELAY_AFTER`: Number of requests allowed before delay in Slow Down middleware.
- `DELAY_MS`: Delay time in Slow Down middleware.
- `LOGGING_FILE_NAME`: Name of the log file.
- `LOGGING_LEVEL`: Log level.

## Notes

- In a production environment, configure appropriate security measures such as HTTPS and secure CORS settings.
- Customize and enhance security further according to your application's requirements.
